## Hi, I’m Danny

I am a Data & ML Engineer with over 10 years of experience building production-grade data systems across fintech, FMCG, and SME platforms. My work bridges the gap between data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning, with a heavy focus on near-real-time pipelines and scalable model deployment.

### Technical Toolkit
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Rust
- **Data Engineering**: Data Modeling, Data Warehousing, Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Airflow
- **Machine Learning**: Model Deployment, Model Training, RAG, Sklearn, PyTorch, Keras, OpenAI, Vector Databases
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: FastAPI, CI/CD, IaC, AWS, Linux

### Featured Projects
- **[E-commerce Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/ecomm-data-pipeline)**  
  End-to-end analytics pipeline using AWS S3, Databricks Declarative Pipelines, Delta Lake, dbt, and Tableau.  

- **[Weather Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/weather-data-pipeline)**  
  Automated pipeline ingesting weather data from an external API into S3 and Snowflake, orchestrated with Apache Airflow.    

- **[Employee Churn Prediction](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-employee-churn-prediction)**  
  Machine learning project with multiple classification models, FastAPI-based inference service, Dockerized and deployed on Render.  

- **[Face Recognition](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-face-recognition)**  
  Face recognition project focused on model training, hyperparameter tuning, and embedding-based inference using deep learning.

- **[Small Language Model](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-small-language-model)**  
  A Keras-based Transformer with a Rust/Axum inference service and ONNX quantization, deployed on local Kubernetes via kind.
