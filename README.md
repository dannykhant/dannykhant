## Hi, I’m Danny

I’m a Data Engineer focused on building reliable, scalable data platforms for analytics and machine learning. I enjoy turning raw, messy data into clean, well-modeled datasets that teams can actually trust.

My work sits at the intersection of **data engineering, cloud infrastructure, and ML systems** — with a strong emphasis on production readiness, observability, and reproducibility.

### What I Work With
- **Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Data Engineering**: ETL/ELT, data modeling, data quality, incremental processing
- **ML Engineering**: Feature preparation, model training, evaluation, and inference workflows

### Featured Projects
- **[E-commerce Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/ecomm-data-pipeline)**  
  End-to-end analytics pipeline using AWS S3, Databricks Declarative Pipelines, Delta Lake, dbt, and Tableau.  
  *Focus: medallion architecture, data modeling, and analytics-ready outputs.*

- **[Weather Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/weather-data-pipeline)**  
  Automated pipeline ingesting weather data from an external API into S3 and Snowflake, orchestrated with Apache Airflow.    
  *Focus: API ingestion, workflow orchestration, scheduling, and end-to-end pipeline automation.*

- **[Employee Churn Prediction](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-employee-churn-prediction)**  
  Machine learning project with multiple classification models, FastAPI-based inference service, Dockerized and deployed on Render.  
  *Focus: ML workflow, model evaluation, and deployment.*

- **[Face Recognition](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-face-recognition)**  
  Face recognition project focused on model training, hyperparameter tuning, and embedding-based inference using deep learning.  
  *Focus: transfer learning, model evaluation, and inference logic.*
