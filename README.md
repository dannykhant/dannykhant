## Hi, I’m Danny

I am an Engineer specializing in Data, ML, and LLM Engineering. With over 10 years of experience, I design and scale production-grade systems across fintech, FMCG, and SME sectors. I specialize in developing scalable data architectures, machine learning workflows, and AI-driven solutions using Python and Rust.

### Technical Toolkit
- **Languages**: Python, Rust, SQL
- **Data Engineering**: Medallion Architecture, Data Lakehouse, Distributed Processing, Data Modeling, Workflow Orchestration (DAGs), Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **AI & LLM Engineering**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLM), Vector Databases, Embedding-based Inference, Model Quantization (ONNX)
- **Machine Learning Ops**: Model Training & Deployment, Distributed Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, Feature Engineering, Model Monitoring
- **Infrastructure & Systems**: High-Performance Inference Services, Containerization, CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Cloud-Native Architectures, Linux Systems

### Featured Projects
- **[5K Running Coach](https://github.com/dannykhant/running-coach-5k)**  
  A production-ready RAG system utilizing hybrid search techniques and rigorous evaluation to provide expert running guidance.
  
- **[E-commerce Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/ecomm-data-pipeline)**  
  End-to-end analytics pipeline implementing a Medallion Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) with declarative data pipelines and versioned data storage.

- **[Weather Data Pipeline](https://github.com/dannykhant/weather-data-pipeline)**  
  Automated ingestion engine for external API data into a cloud data warehouse, orchestrated using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for workflow management.

- **[Employee Churn Prediction](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-employee-churn-prediction)**  
  Machine learning system featuring multiple classification models and a high-concurrency FastAPI inference service, fully containerized for deployment.  

- **[Face Recognition](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-face-recognition)**  
  Deep learning project focused on model training, hyperparameter tuning, and embedding-based inference using neural networks.

- **[Small Language Model](https://github.com/dannykhant/mlz-small-language-model)**  
  Transformer-based model featuring a Rust-based inference service, ONNX quantization, and orchestration via local container clusters.
